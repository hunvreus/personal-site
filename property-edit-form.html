                <h2>Context & Goals</h2>
                <p>One of the ways Catylist gathered commercial real estate data was through crowdsourcing. Users often submitted changes to properties through a small form, which was then processed by our research team.</p>
                <p>At first, users could only submit edits for a small number of data fields. But the decision was made to allow them to edit any of the 100+ fields that a property could have. This was a common request from users and made sense from a business standpoint because it allowed us to gather more data (always a good thing).</p>
                <p>I was assigned to design the page where users could edit all these fields.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>Designing any form can get complicated, but designing a form with 100+ fields all on the same page is quite a task.</p>
                <p>I built a prototype with several ideas and showed it to some users and our support staff (since they were talking to users on a consistent basis). One thing I learned is that sometimes users didn't understand what some fields were referring to. So we added a notation when the user clicked on a field (see below).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/img/case-studies/form.png" alt="Form">
                    <figcaption>When a field was active, a note showed up in the sidebar explaining what that field was.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Since the scope of the page was so large, I designed a couple of features that made the giant page more palatable and gave the user methods to quickly find specific fields.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/img/case-studies/form-search.png" alt="Form Search">
                    <figcaption>Key features helped users navigate the large form.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Finally, I put together a quick onboarding tour that pointed out new pieces of the UI, educating users about the new features.</p>

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>After launch, the new page was very well received. Not only did users appreciate access to all the fields, but we received a lot of praise specifically for the design of the page. And the support team received very few requests about how to use it — a UX win!</p>
                <p>As a company, our data significantly improved.</p>
                <p>I learned a lot about how to build usable forms, and that your support team can be a big resource as a designer.</p>
