                <h2>Context & Goals</h2>
                <p>Catylist is a commercial real estate data company, and most of the data is gathered by internal researchers.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to completely redesign the app the researchers used to gather, process, and submit new data.</p>
                <p>The researchers had a set of complex, standardized methods for the work they did. I needed to create an app tailored to those specific methods.</p>

                        <img class="aside_icon" src="/img/info.svg" alt="Important">
                        <p class="mb0">Researchers are all about data captured per time spent. So the focus was almost entirely on efficiency of task.</p>
                    </aside>
                </div>
                <p>The app also needed to be scalable since the research team was going to keep growing.</p>

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/img/case-studies/user-interview.png" alt="User Interview">
                    <figcaption>Myself interviewing a researcher.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Because of the complexity and standardization of their tasks, I knew I needed to work alongside the researchers and their managers to develop the app.</p>
                <p>I used many methods to make sure all design work stemmed from user needs and wants, including the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performed remote <span class="bold">usability tests and user interviews</span> with the researchers. Usually, this involved them screen sharing and demonstrating how they performed specific tasks. I analyzed these interviews using Dovetail to pull out insights that I then applied to the designs. Many ideas came from this process.</li>
                    <li>Completed <span class="bold">field studies</span>, where I met with the researchers in person and observed them as they worked so that I could learn more about the process and get a better understanding of their day-to-day.</li>
                    <li>Developed <span class="bold">prototypes</span> for major features, so I could run them by the research managers first before committing to a final design.</li>
                    <li>Created a <span class="bold">dedicated Slack channel</span> where researchers could drop feedback and suggestions at any time. I gathered and collated all those suggestions, and then we reviewed them monthly as a product team.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This was an iterative project that I added to and adjusted over a long period of time as we gathered input from the researchers and learned about their process. It adapted and evolved as needs arose and ideas were brought up. </p>

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/img/case-studies/research-app.png" alt="Research App">
                    <figcaption>Screenshot of one of the pages from the app. Blurred for privacy.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The result was a highly efficient app tailored to the specific needs of its users. Managers reported that researcher productivity increased dramatically.</p>
                <p>The product team received a lot of praise from the researchers themselves, most of whom had used other research apps and compared it very favorably to ours.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "This is amazing! It's so much better than any other research app I've used before."<br>
                        â€“ Researcher
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The company was also able to scale the research team easily and quickly with almost no complications.</p>
                <p>The app became the driving force behind much of the value we offered to our end customers.</p>
                <p>For me, this project drove home the importance of involving users in the design process. Its success can be largely traced back to the insights I gathered through user research and participatory design.</p>
