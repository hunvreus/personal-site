                <h2>Context & Goals</h2>
                <p>With 12 developers and an ecosystem of websites and apps, it was clear that Catylist needed a solid design system.</p>
                <p>I knew a design system would:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mb0">Provide design consistency.</li>
                    <li class="mb0">Give the team a shared vocabulary.</li>
                    <li class="mb0">Improve maintainability and productivity with the design and code.</li>
                    <li>Give us a way to examine and improve modular pieces of the UI.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So I presented the idea and was given permission to work on it. The goal was to create an effective system that matched the brand, and then document it for everyone's reference.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>I met with several stakeholders to make sure we were aligned on the branding and general business requirements.</p>
                <p>Then I began with an analysis: researching competitive design systems, recording common pieces of UI we already used regularly, and figuring out what kinds of components would make the developers' work easier.</p>
                <p>Over a few weeks, I took the information I had gathered and built out each piece of the system one by one with HTML and CSS. I worked closely with my product manager and a couple of developers along the way. </p>
                <div class="aside-container">
                    <aside class="info pt4 pb4 pl5 pr5">
                        <img class="aside_icon" src="/img/info.svg" alt="Important">
                        <p class="mb0">Usability and accessibility were critical. We had lots of users who were middle-aged or older and some of them weren't as familiar with interfaces as a younger audience would have been. So clarity and accounting for issues like color blindness were important considerations.</p>
                    </aside>
                </div>
                <p>After creating all the components, I created a website that the team could use for reference. This site included every component broken down by category, with notes on how and where to use them, and the required HTML and CSS.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/img/case-studies/design-system.jpg" alt="Design System">
                    <figcaption>Screenshot of the internal website I built for the design system.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The product manager and developers were very impressed with the new system and appreciated how much clearer and more productive it made front-end development.</p>
                <p>After applying this updated styling across all websites and apps, the branding and product lineup felt much more cohesive and thought out.</p>
                <p>And of course, a design system is never finished. I continually adjusted and added to it throughout my time at Catylist.</p>

                        <p>I designed a task-efficient app used by internal researchers at Catylist. The process included usability tests, user interviews, and field&nbsp;studies.</p>

                        <p>I designed a huge form with 100+ fields for users to submit property edits. Included a few features that helped the user quickly find&nbsp;fields.</p>
